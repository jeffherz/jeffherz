## About Me
#### While in school, I fell in love with graphic design and all things technology.  While using Adobe Illustrator and other design applications, I became interested in how the programs worked which led me to learning about software development.  I realized I could use my graphic design skills to create useful and easy to understand programs that anybody could use.  

#### I recently graduated from Tech Elevator, a 14-week Java bootcamp, in Cleveland, Ohio.  While at Tech Elevator, I used Java, PostgreSQL, web APIs, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a vending machine application, national parks campsite registration, mobile banking app, and a meal planner. I learned a lot of new and exciting programs and am eager to continue learning.

### Looking forward to working with you in the future!
